# Create resources with `PATCH`

From [RFC 5689 section #2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-2):

> If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.
